There are 3 different frameworks used to define probability:

Classical: works really well for equally likely outcome, but it's difficult to apply to more complex problems.
Frequentist: requires to have infinite events so that the frequency of them can be estimated
Bayessian: in this framework, your probability represents your own perspective.
