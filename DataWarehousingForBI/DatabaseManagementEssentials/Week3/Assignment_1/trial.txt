1. List the city, state, and zip codes in the customer table. Your result should not have
duplicates. (Hint: The DISTINCT keyword eliminates duplicates.)

SELECT DISTINCT 
	city, state, zip
FROM 
	customer;

2. List the name, department, phone number, and email address of employees with a phone
number beginning with “3-”

SELECT 
	empName, department, phone, email
FROM 
	employee
WHERE
	phone LIKE "3-%";


3. List all columns of the resource table with a rate between $10 and $20. Sort the result by rate

SELECT *
FROM 
	ResourceTbl
WHERE
	rate > 10 and rate < 20;


4. List the event requests with a status of “Approved” or “Denied” and an authorized date in
July 2018. Include the event number, authorization date, and status in the output. (Hint: see
the examples in Module 4 for date constants in Oracle and MySQL.)

SELECT 
	evntNo, dateAuth, status
FROM 
	eventrequest
WHERE 
	(status <> "Approved" OR status <> "Denied") AND dateAuth <> "2013-07-31";


5. List the location number and name of locations that are part of the “Basketball arena”. Your
WHERE clause should not have a condition involving the facility number compared to a
constant (“F101”). Instead, you should use a condition on the FacName column for the value
of “Basketball arena”

SELECT 
	* 
FROM 
	facility 
WHERE 
	facName <> "Basketball arena";


6. For each event plan, list the plan number, count of the event plan lines, and sum of the
number of resources assigned. For example, plan number “P100” has 4 lines and 7 resources
assigned. You only need to consider event plans that have at least one line

SELECT 
	planNo, COUNT(lineNo), SUM(numberFLD)
FROM 
	eventplanline
GROUP BY
	planNo
HAVING
	COUNT(lineNo) >= 1;
